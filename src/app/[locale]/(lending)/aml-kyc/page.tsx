The Client has to deliver an official confirmation of transfer (i.e. remittance slip) and validate that the deposit order is carried out according to the Company’s requirements. Absence of such confirmation or incompatibility between account and Client’s details might cause a transfer to a wrong account, or cause the rejection/loss of the request, cause the Company to recall the deposit amount to the transferring bank, and eventually could result in the cancelation of the deposit order. Any withdrawal carried out by bank transfer, will be only be transferred to the bank account that the deposit money had originated. b. Global Investment clients can withdraw their funds and benefits whenever they need to. To request a partial or complete withdrawal of funds from your account, click on “Withdrawal request” in your account. Please consider that we take up to 24 hours to process your withdrawal request. Corresponding withdrawals will take up to 2‐5 business days to reach your credit card or bank account. Minimum withdrawal amount with a credit card is 200 USD/EUR , and as for the bank wire transfers the minimum is 500 USD/EUR (depending from the account currency). Feel free to contact our Customer support specialist if you have any questions. According to generally acceptable AML rules and regulations, withdrawals must be performed only through the same bank account or credit/debit card that you used to deposit the funds. Furthermore, when it comes to withdrawals, Client may be required to present additional information and documents. The Company will pay the Client by way of bank wire or transfer to his credit card account that was used when the deposit was made, following the Client’s withdrawal order. The Company will endeavor to pay the Client in accordance with Client’s chosen mean. Without prejudice to the aforesaid, the Company reserves the right to pay the Client by different means in accordance with Client’s type of credit card and/or Company’s internal regulations. Credit card withdrawal shall be performed at times and according to the Credit card Company’s procedures. As the withdrawal request is pending (no confirmation has been given to the Client by the Company), the Client may ask to stop the withdrawal process, according to the instructions, leaving the balance of his account intact. Once effected, the withdrawal process will immediately make the client’s money available in his trading account. Client accepts and confirms that upon completion of the withdrawal request, he will no longer be allowed to request withdrawal cancelation. Subject to paragraph 7.4, if the Client had requested to carry out multiple withdrawals and subsequently requested to carry out multiple stop withdrawals, he may first cancel the former withdrawal request and once stopped the Client may continue on with the remaining requests. Client requests to withdrawal funds from his account, which remain incomplete five days after the request, will cause the Company to refund the withdrawal amount back to the Client’s account. When you open an account with The Company the payment will be debited from your credit card immediately. If you are not satisfied with The Company trading platform for any reason, you have the right to apply for a refund of your remaining balance. Please note that if you have received a trading credit, you will have to follow the trading credit T&C. If you decide to apply to refund your purchase, all logins and memberships will be deactivated. Whether your application will be approved or declined shall be at the sole discretion of the Company. Please allow up to 48 hours for our customer support team to approach your request. Our support team will contact you to confirm your request or to ask for additional information if needed. All refunds will be issued in the form of payment in which they were made. According to our AML Policy (Anti‐Money Laundering) every client is obliged to turnover his investment in Margin, at least once before being eligible for a withdrawal. Example if client has 1,000 balance and operated on leverage 1:100, he would have to make a turnover of 1,000*100 = 100,000 or 1 lot before being able to withdraw. if leverage is 1:500 then turnover would be 1,000*500 = 500,000 or 5 lots. Once turnover is met, the client is entitled to request a withdrawal of full amount deposited with profits, minus any trading credit received from the company, minus any trading credit received from the company.
